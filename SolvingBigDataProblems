### üîç Titanic Survival Analysis: Insights from the Charts

#### 1. **Survival Rate by Gender**
- **Females had a 100% survival rate**, while **males had 0%** in this sample.
- This reflects the historical evacuation policy of **"women and children first."**

#### 2. **Survival Rate by Age Group**
- **Children (0‚Äì12)** and **Seniors (51‚Äì80)** had the **highest survival rates**.
- **Young Adults and Adults** had noticeably **lower survival rates**.
- This may indicate prioritization of the very young and very old during evacuation.

#### 3. **Survival Rate by Passenger Class**
- **1st Class passengers** had the highest survival rate (~47%).
- **2nd and 3rd Class** passengers had similar but lower survival rates (~32‚Äì33%).
- Suggests **access to lifeboats and evacuation priority was skewed by class**, with 1st Class passengers having clear advantages.

These charts paint a clear picture: **gender, age, and class were all critical factors** in determining who survived the Titanic disaster.
